LIQUIDATED DAMAGES LEGAL REFERENCE

1. LEGAL BASIS
Liquidated damages are pre-determined compensation amounts specified in contracts for breach. 
They must represent a genuine pre-estimate of loss and not constitute a penalty.

2. KEY PRINCIPLES
- Must be proportionate to anticipated harm
- Cannot be punitive in nature
- Should be stated clearly and unambiguously
- Courts may reduce if deemed excessive

3. CALCULATION METHODS
Common approaches include:
a) Fixed amount per breach
b) Daily rate until remedy
c) Percentage of contract value
d) Graduated scale based on delay period

4. ENFORCEABILITY FACTORS
Courts consider:
- Commercial justification
- Reasonableness of amount
- Relationship to actual losses
- Good faith negotiations

5. SAMPLE CLAUSE
"In the event of Contractor's failure to complete the Works by the Completion Date,
Contractor shall pay to Employer liquidated damages at the rate of [£X] per day
of delay, up to a maximum of [Y%] of the Contract Price."

6. BEST PRACTICES
- Clearly state triggering events
- Specify calculation methodology
- Include maximum caps
- Distinguish from penalties
- Address mitigation duties
